/**
 A snapshot is a view-homogenous set of snapshosts.
 
 The idea is that you can provide different configurations for the same view.
 Each configuration is basically a view model.
 Since the view should be 100% configured from the view model, it should be possible to
 create every situation the view could be presented.
 
 ## Container
 It is also possible to specify a container in which the view is embedded. A container can be
 a tabbar, a navigation controller or just nothing. Since these additional UIs should be configured from the
 view, these additional UI elements will be styled and properly rendered as well.
 
 # Hooks
 Sometimes it is required to execute some arbitrary code during the view lifecycle.
 Hooks can be used to customize the behaviour of the mocked view controller that renders the view.
